THE TEST SUITES

1. RSS Feeds - makes sure that the feed is defined
2. URL + Name defined - makes sure that the actual url and name exist
3. The menu - checks to see if that menu is hidden by default, then checks to see if it changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
4. Initial entries - when "loadFeed" function is called and completes its work, make sure that there is at least a single .entry element in the .feed container
5. New Feed Selection - ensures when a new feed is loaded by the "loadFeed" function that content changes
